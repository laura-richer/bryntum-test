 * @property {Boolean} isNonWorking `true` if the owning view considers the date a non-working day.
 * @property {Number[]} week The `[year, week]` encapsulating the cell.
 * @property {Boolean} isOtherMonth The cell is outside the view's primary time range. Only significant

         * This is relayed through the owning {@link Calendar.view.Calendar}, so a single listener
         * may be used, for example:
         *
         * ```javascript
         * new Calendar({
         *     listeners : {
         *         eventPropagate(eventData) {
         *             // If the event only spills into the next day but not further
         *             // then we do not want an extended event bar.
         *             // An arrow will indicate that it continues rightwards.
         *             if (eventData.eventEndDate < DateHelper.add(eventData.date, 2, 'd')) {
         *                 eventData.propagateEndDate = DateHelper.add(DateHelper.clearTime(eventData.eventRecord.startDate), 1, 'd');
         *             }
         *         }
         *     }
         * })
         * ```
         *
         * The `eventEndDate` in the data block may also be changed to override the event's real end date.
         * This will mean that there will be no arrow indicating that the event continues:
         *
         * ```javascript
         * new Calendar({
         *     listeners : {
         *         eventPropagate(eventData) {
         *             // If the event spills into the next day but not further
         *             // then we do not want an extended event bar.
         *             // Because we override the eventEndDate, no arrow will be present
         *             // to indicate any continuation.
         *             if (eventData.eventEndDate < DateHelper.add(eventData.date, 2, 'd')) {
         *                 eventData.propagateEndDate = eventData.eventEndDate = DateHelper.add(DateHelper.clearTime(eventData.eventRecord.startDate), 1, 'd');
         *             }
         *         }
         *     }
         * });
         * ```
         *
